## Distributed Interactive Games and Illusions Testing

## What is it?

Distributed Interactive Games and Illusions Testing (DIGIT) is a web application that tests user’s perception of optical illusions and compares their results to others to determine how they perceive color and contrast. The web application was developed for the use of Doctor Arthur Shapiro, a Computer Science and Psychology professor at American University. The project hosts Doctor Shapiro’s optical illusions and acts as a replacement for his old website which no longer meets web standards as it is centered around the use of Adobe Flash player. The web application extends beyond being just a host for optical illusions but instead turns the illusions into a user based experience. When visiting DIGIT, the user logs-in using a Google account and can interact with illusions and submit results. The user can then compare their results with others through the visualizations created using the backend database.
